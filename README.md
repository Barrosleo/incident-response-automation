# Incident Response Automation & Orchestration Platform

This project automates incident response by executing predefined playbooks when alerts are triggered. It simulates real-time incident remediation—isolating endpoints, sending notifications via Slack/email, logging workflow actions, and generating incident reports.

## Key Features
```
- Automated response playbooks (rule-based/ML-assisted)
- Integration with communication channels for alerting
- Orchestration engine that coordinates remediation steps
- Detailed logging and incident report generation
```
## How to Run
```
1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Configure environment variables in a `.env` file.
3. Start the application: npm start
```
